* magit-gh-pulls

  magit-gh-pulls is a [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]] extension that allows you to conveniently manipulate
  Github's pull requests from Emacs.

** Installation

   magit-gh-pulls is available on [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]]. To install it do the following:

   : M-x package-install RET magit-gh-pulls RET

   Now that the package is installed you have to put the following code to your
   =init.el=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'magit-gh-pulls)
(add-hook 'magit-mode-hook 'turn-on-magit-gh-pulls)
   #+END_SRC

***** Private repository configuration

      Currently, ~magit-gh-pulls~ tries to fetch everything using the
      ~git://~ protocol.  This doesn't work for private repositories.  A
      workaround for this is to use git URL rewrite rule:

      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      $ git config url.git@github.com:.insteadOf git://github.com/
      #+END_EXAMPLE

      A proper fix for this is being tracked in #58.

** Usage

***** Existing Pull Requests

      In =magit-status= window press =# g g= to refresh the list of pull requests.
      magit-gh-pulls automatically infers credentials from the URL of the
      repository. If there are some PRs available, a new section will appear
      called *Pull Requests*. Each item in this section has the following form:

      : [pull-request-number@branch-name] Pull request name

      Highlighting the desired PR and pressing =# g f= will fetch the commits
      associated with the PR. These are the real commits that you can view, apply,
      cherry-pick etc.

      From this point magit-gh-pulls offers you two options:

      - press =# g b= on the PR to create a topic branch for this PR. After testing
        the PR you can merge it back into your branch using Magit.
      - press =# g m= to merge the PR on top of the currently checked out branch.
        This is convenient if pull request can be merged by fast-forwarding and
        no testing is needed (or you can test from your branch directly). A nice
        benefit of this approach over merging from Github interface is that in
        case of FF no merge commit is produced, so history stays nice and linear.

***** Creating Pull Requests

      In =magit-status= press =# g c= to create a new pull request.  You will be asked
      for the base commit and the head commit for the pull-request.  They will default
      to the default branch of your repository and current head respecively.  Enter a title
      and description for the pull request, and magit-gh-pulls will connect to GitHub to
      create the pull request.  By default,
      the new pullrequest will be opened on github.com in the browser.  You may
      turn this behavior off by customizing =magit-gh-pulls-open-new-pr-in-browser=

      The base and head of the pull request must already be present on github.
      If you haven't yet pushed your local commits, creating the pull request will fail.
      You can push with magit's standard =P P=.

      
***** Miscellaneous

      - =# g o= Will open the selected a pull request in your default browser on GitHub.
      - =j q= will jump to the Pull Requests section in the =magit-status= window.
